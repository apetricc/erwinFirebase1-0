# Add wifiMap code to Firebase platform base code

Erwin wifi map uses the Google Maps API and a real-time database using Firebase to save wifi hotspots on a map and set markers on wifi hotspots saved by other users logged in to the database.  Currently, a Google account is needed to sign in, but this parameter may be modified to support any email, only certain emails, or anonymous users (anyone). 
To build Erwin Wifi Map web app several examples were used in addition to the documentation for the Google Maps API and Firebase. Firebase is also used for deployment of the web app itself.
