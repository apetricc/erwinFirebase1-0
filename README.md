# Erwin wifiMap -- using Firebase platform

Erwin wifi map uses the Google Maps API and a real-time database using Firebase to save wifi hotspots on a map and set markers on wifi
hotspots saved by other users logged in to the database.  Currently, a Google account is needed to sign in, but this parameter may be
modified to support any email, only certain emails, or anonymous users (anyone). 
To build the Erwin Wifi Map web app several examples were referenced including the Firebase Code Labs, Firebase Firecasts on YouTube,
YouTuber TVAC's Firebase Database Web videos, and Udacity's Google Maps videos in addition to the documentation for the Google Maps API and
Firebase. Firebase is also used for deployment of the web app itself.
